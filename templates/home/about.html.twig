    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        We are definitely real "humans" and not sasquatch hiding in plain site. 
        We enjoy doing many popular human things, such as "showering under
        warm water" and "moving a brush on top of our teeth".
        We definitely do not enjoy hiding from other humans nor hunting
        with our bare claws, I mean, hands.
